If you think you may have found a bug in FlexibleSUSY, which is not
listed below, please file a bug report at

Known problems
==============

Exception due to multi-threading
--------------------------------

If FlexibleSUSY exits with an exception indicating that threads cannot
be opened (which happens for example with g++ 4.8.x), one can try
adding "-Wl,--no-as-needed" to the CXXFLAGS, i.e. for example

   ./configure --with-cxxflags="-Wl,--no-as-needed -std=c++11 -O2"

If this does not solve the problem, one can disable multi-threading
via

   ./configure --disable-threads


Tensor couplings
----------------

FlexibleSUSY cannot yet deal with tensor couplings (matrix-like
couplings with rank 3, i.e. with 3 or more indices) in the
Lagrangian/Superpotential.  In order to make such models work in
FlexibleSUSY, please split the tensor coupling terms in the
Lagrangian/Superpotential into a sum of terms with a matrix-like
coupling structure of rank 2 or less.


4th generation
--------------

FlexibleSUSY cannot yet include all effects from fermions, which mix
with the Standard Model fermions, in the extraction of the running
Yukawa couplings.  In such models, the Yukawa couplings have to be
fixed by hand in one boundary condition.  FlexibleSUSY provides the
symbols

 * upQuarksDRbar = (m_u, m_s, m_t)
 * downQuarksDRbar = (m_d, m_c,m_b)
 * downLeptonsDRbar = (m_e, m_\mu, m_\tau)

to access the running Standard Model fermion masses in such models.
See the munuSSM model file for an example, where the charginos mix
with the Standard Model fermions.  In this model the down-type lepton
Yukawa matrix is fixed in an approximated form at the low-energy scale
given the running SM charged lepton masses.
