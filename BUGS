Known problems
==============

Expressing the Weinberg angle in terms of the gauge couplings
-------------------------------------------------------------

Currently FlexibleSUSY needs to express the Weinberg angle ThetaW in
terms of running DR-bar parameters, as gauge couplings etc.  The
reason is that SARAH expresses some mass matrices and vertices in
terms of ThetaW.  Since these mass matrices need to be sometimes
calculated in the DR-bar scheme, ThetaW needs to be known in the
DR-bar scheme as well.  And this is can be done by expressing ThetaW
in terms of the fundamental DR-bar parameters.

However, it can happen that Mathematica and FlexibleSUSY are not able
to express ThetaW in terms of the fundamental DR-bar parameters.  This
happens for examples in models with extra U(1) gauge groups, where Z
and Z' mix.  In this case the following error occurs:

   ExpressWeinbergAngleInTermsOfGaugeCouplings::noSolution: 
   Error: could not express the Weinberg angle ThetaW
     in terms of the gauge couplings. ...

In this case FlexibleSUSY will use the Standard Model definition of
ThetaW

   ThetaW = ArcTan[g1/g2] ,

plus a GUT normalization of g1, if defined.  However, this definition
might not be correct in each model.

In future versions of FlexibleSUSY, ThetaW will be eliminated
completely from all expressions and replaced by the value given in
SARAH`DependenceSPheno in the SARAH`ParameterDefinitionsMain list.  By
default this value is (see SARAH/Modesl/parameters.m)

   DependenceSPheno -> ArcCos[Abs[ZZ[1,1]]]
