If you think you may have found a bug in FlexibleSUSY, which is not
listed below, please file a bug report at

Known problems
==============

Exception due to multi-threading
--------------------------------

If FlexibleSUSY exits with an exception indicating that threads cannot
be opened (which happens for example with g++ 4.8.x), one can try
adding "-Wl,--no-as-needed" to the CXXFLAGS, i.e. for example

   ./configure --with-cxxflags="-Wl,--no-as-needed -std=c++11 -O2"

If this does not solve the problem, one can disable multi-threading
via

   ./configure --disable-threads


Tensor couplings
----------------

FlexibleSUSY cannot yet deal with tensor couplings (couplings with 3
or more indices) in the Lagrangian/Superpotential.  In order to make
such models work in FlexibleSUSY, please split the tensor coupling
terms in the Lagrangian/Superpotential into a sum of terms with a
matrix coupling structure.
