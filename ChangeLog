FlexibleSUSY-0.5.2 [January 14, 2014]

 * Bugfix (commit 58f8f9): Convert beta functions which are identical
   zero to the data type of the corresponding parameter.

 * Bugfix (commit e5f937): Correcting check of SARAH patch level
   against minimum required patch level.

 * Bugfix (commit e2d43b): Adapting free phases of fermion fields if
   mass is less than zero.

 * Bugfix (commit e777e1): Converting indices to C convention in
   tree-level EWSB equations.

 * Set minimum required SARAH version to 4.0.3, because it includes a
   bug fix in the index structure of the charged Higgs self-energies.

 * Allow setting of single matrix/ vector elements in the constraints.

 * Model files are now in the directory model_files/
   (instead of templates/)

 * The command line arguments of the createmodel script changed.
   Please see ./createmodel --help for more details.

 * Add support for the LHInput[p] command in constraints, which reads
   the parameter `p' from the SLHA input file.

 * Constrain time used to simplify the beta functions (default: 120
   seconds per beta function).  To change the time constraint, set
   FlexibleSUSY`FSSimplifyBetaFunctionsTimeConstraint .

 * Avoid swapping by distributing the calculation of the two-scale
   beta functions among multiple .cpp files.

 * Introduce separate meta code stamp (triggers running of the meta
   code) with name models/<model-name>/00_DELETE_ME_TO_RERUN_METACODE

FlexibleSUSY-0.5.1 [November 23, 2013]

 * Handle parameters of type vector in the beta functions.

FlexibleSUSY-0.5 [November 18, 2013]

 * Store particle masses as Eigen::Array and mixing matrices as
   Eigen::Matrix.
