FlexibleSUSY-1.3.0 [January, 08 2016]

 * Feature: The output of the spectrum generator can be written into
   an SQLite database using the --database-output-file= option.  At
   the C++ level, a to_database() and from_database() function is
   provided for each model, which write/read a model object (including
   the DR-bar parameters and the pole mass spectrum) to/from a
   database file.

   Example:
   $ models/CMSSM/run_CMSSM.x \
     --slha-input-file=model_files/CMSSM/LesHouches.in.CMSSM \
     --slha-output-file= --database-output-file=point.db

   Example using the scan script:
   $ utils/scan-database.sh \
     --spectrum-generator=models/CMSSM/run_CMSSM.x \
     --slha-input-file=model_files/CMSSM/LesHouches.in.CMSSM \
     --scan-range=MINPAR[3]=1~30:21 \
     --database-output-file=scan.db

 * Feature: Models can now be matched to the Standard Model at Q =
   MZ_pole, Q = MT_pole or any other dynamically calculated scale, as
   MT_DRbar for example.
   To match at MZ_pole set in the model file: LowScale = LowEnergyConstant[MZ]
   To match at MT_pole set in the model file: LowScale = LowEnergyConstant[MT]
   To match at MT_DRbar set in the model file: LowScale = M[Fu[3]],
   depending on your chosen name for the top quark.

 * Feature: 3-loop beta-functions can now be used in the real MSSM.
   To enable the 3-loop MSSM beta-functions, set UseMSSM3LoopRGEs =
   True; in the model file (enabled by default in all real MSSM models
   that are shipped with FlexibleSUSY).  The expressions have been
   obtained from http://www.liv.ac.uk/~dij/betas/allgennb.log and
   include family mixing.

   Note: The 3-loop beta-functions for the vacuum expectation values
   vu and vd are not available so far.  Furthermore, the 3-loop MSSM
   beta-functions miss the "tadpole" contributions corresponding to
   the renormalisation of the Fayet-Iliopoulos D-term, see the note in
   Section 2, page 4 of arxiv:hep-ph/0308231 .

 * Feature: The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, (g-2)/2, can be
   calculated in all MSSM models without sfermion flavour violation
   (e.g. the MSSMNoFV and CMSSMNoFV).  The calculation is performed
   with GM2Calc 1.1.0 [arXiv:1510.08071] up to the 2-loop level
   including tan(beta) resummation.

   In order to enable the calculation of (g-2)/2, the symbols

      FlexibleSUSYObservable`aMuonGM2Calc
      FlexibleSUSYObservable`aMuonGM2CalcUncertainty

   have to be added to ExtraSLHAOutputBlocks variable in the
   FlexibleSUSY model file (they are already added in the MSSMNoFV and
   CMSSMNoFV example models).  In addition, the SLHA input file entry
   FlexibleSUSY[15] has to be set to 1 to perform the calculation.  If
   FlexibleSUSY[15] is set to 0, (g-2)/2 is not calculated.

 * Change (commit d553af8): No SLHA output is written if the option
   --slha-output-file= is set to the empty string.  To write the SLHA
   output to stdout, set --slha-output-file=- (this is the default).

 * Change (commit ac70fec): In the SM the Higgs pole mass is no longer
   calculated at the scale Qin (= the scale where lambda is input),
   but at the scale Q = M_top.

 * Bugfix (commit 1b4fc20): Correcting W contribution in beta-function
   of alpha_em in the SM with 5 active quark flavours.
   Imported from SoftSUSY (commit 0139daa).

 * Bugfix (commit d7dbeb6): Adding neutrino charge, Qv, to list of
   input parameters in the UMSSM.  This fixes a compilation error with
   SARAH 4.6.0.

 * Bugfix (commit f1752a7): Correcting the trilinear couplings and the
   effective mu parameter in the NMSSMRUN SLHA output block in the
   models: NMSSM, NMSSMCPV, NUTNMSSM, SMSSM and NUTSMSSM.

 * Bugfix (commit 9ccdb4d): Workaround a SARAH issue where the list
   SARAH`Masses[EWSB] contains replacement rules of the form `0 ->
   MassGiven[X]', instead of `Mass[X] -> MassGiven[X]'.  Due to this
   issue some massless particles have been missing in FlexibleSUSY
   before commit 9ccdb4d.

FlexibleSUSY-1.2.4 [October, 27 2015]

 * Change (commit 33af37c): The spectrum generator, run_<model>.x,
   will no longer overwrite the user-given input parameters of the
   SMINPUTS block.

 * Bugfix (commit 9067f3a): There was an internal programming error in
   the meta code concerning the assignment of tadpole diagrams to the
   Higgs fields, which resulted in a compilation error in the SSM.
   Thanks to John McDowall.

 * Bugfix (commit 77d2a86): Ensure that in the calculation of the pole
   mass of a fermion singlet the prefactor of the self-energies is the
   positive tree-level mass.  Before commit ce1ef83, the prefactor of
   the gluino self-energies in MSSM for example was the soft-breaking
   parameter M3.  If M3 < 0 the gluino pole mass was not calculated
   correctly.
   Thanks to Dylan Harries and Roman Nevzorov.

FlexibleSUSY-1.2.3 [October, 18 2015]

 * Feature: Adding support for If[] and Which[] statements at the
   r.h.s. of contraints.  In addition, the IsClose[a,b,eps] and
   IsCloseRel[a,b,eps] functions have been added to allow for a
   comparison of parameters.

 * Feature: New model SplitMSSM, which implements low-energy EFT of
   the MSSM where the sfermions and one Higgs doublet have been
   integrated out.  The model implements the 1- and 2-loop matching
   conditions from arxiv:1407.4081.  The Higgs pole mass is calculated
   at complete 1-loop order plus 2-loop contributions O(alpha_t^2) and
   O(alpha_t alpha_s) from arxiv:1205.6497 plus 3-loop leading-log
   contribution from the gluino O(alpha_t alpha_s^2)
   (arxiv:1312.5220).

 * Feature: New model HSSUSY, which implements a high-scale SUSY
   scenario, where the sfermions, the gauginos, the Higgsinos and one
   Higgs doublet have been integrated out, leaving the Standard Model
   as low-energy EFT.  The model uses the 3-loop Standard Model RGEs
   (arxiv:1303.4364, arXiv:1307.3536) and implements the 1- and 2-loop
   matching conditions to lambda(MSUSY) from arxiv:1407.4081.
   Furthermore, the 1-loop matching conditions O(alpha_b) and
   O(alpha_tau) as well as the 2-loop matching condition O(alpha_t^2)
   from SUSYHD (arxiv:1504.05200) are implemented.  The Higgs pole
   mass is calculated at complete 1-loop order plus 2-loop
   contributions O(alpha_t^2) and O(alpha_t alpha_s) from
   arxiv:1205.6497.  The calculation of the Higgs pole mass in the
   HSSUSY model coincides with the one obtained with SUSYHD 1.0.2 with
   a relative deviation of < 0.06%.

 * Feature: Allow adding 3-loop gluino contribution to Higgs
   self-energy in split-SUSY models with a physical singlet Higgs.
   The 3-loop gluino contribution is enabled by default in the
   SplitMSSM.

 * Change (commit f7cd242): The `test' and `examples' modules are no
   longer loaded into the makefile by default.  To load them, run
   ./configure --with-optional-modules="test,examples"

 * Change (commit e86d23a): The FlexibleSUSY test suite is no longer
   shipped with the release tarball.  It can be obtained from the
   official git repository at
   https://github.com/FlexibleSUSY/FlexibleSUSY .

 * Change (commit 372bb96): Use FlexibleSUSY's own dependency file
   generator instead of using the corresponding compiler capabilities.

 * Bugfix (commit 20e88db): Use correct self-energy for 1st and 2nd
   generation charged leptons in *NoFV models.  Before commit 20e88db,
   the (heavy) tau self-energy was used to convert the running MS-bar
   electron and muon masses to DR-bar masses in *NoFV models.
   Corresponding test case:
   test_CMSSMNoFV_low_scale_constraint::test_delta_Yf()

FlexibleSUSY-1.2.2 [September, 08 2015]

 * Feature: The scale at which the EWSB output parameters are fixed
   can now be chosen by the user via the FSSolveEWSBFor[{...}] symbol.
   By default, the susy-scale is chosen.

 * Change (commit 5b9d653): If ./configure is run without the
   `--with-models=<models>' argument, no models will be build.  In
   former FlexibleSUSY versions if the `--with-models=<models>'
   argument was missing, all models were build.

 * Bugfix (commit 5530bf9): Defining a scale to be a running mass, for
   example SUSYScale = M[hh], resulted in a compilation error.

 * Bugfix (commits 2d6c0d2, 87cfe28): use SLHA input value of the Z
   pole mass as low-energy scale, instead of the hard-coded value MZ =
   91.1876 GeV.

 * Bugfix (commit 1ac0aa0): Use math/physics index convention (index
   starting with 1) in the comments of the extra user-defined SLHA
   output blocks.

 * Bugfix (commit 0737c4d): Properly convert greek symbols in function
   arguments.  Fixes #5.  Thanks to Dylan Harries.

 * Bugfix (commit f4eed5d): Put class Complex into softsusy namespace
   to avoid ambiguities in operator*().  Fixes #6.  Thanks to Dylan
   Harries.

FlexibleSUSY-1.2.1 [July, 07 2015]

 * Feature: The model name is printed in SPINFO[5] and the SARAH
   version is printed in SPINFO[9].

 * Bugfix (fea4d59): The MODSEL block was not read if SLHA input is
   passed to the spectrum generator via stdin.  Thanks to Peter
   Drechsel.

FlexibleSUSY-1.2.0 [June, 26 2015]

 * Feature: Allow the user to add 3-loop beta-functions in the SM.
   The beta-functions are taken from SUSYHD v1.0.1 (arXiv:1504.05200)
   and arxiv:1303.4364.

 * Feature: Allow the user to add 2-loop Higgs self-energy corrections
   O(alpha_t^2 + alpha_t alpha_s) in the SM.  The self-energy
   corrections were taken from arxiv:1205.6497.

 * Feature: Allow the user to provide SLHA input via stdin if the SLHA
   input file name is set to - .
   Example:
   $ cat model_files/CMSSM/LesHouches.in.CMSSM | \
        models/CMSSM/run_CMSSM.x --slha-input-file=-

 * Feature: Allow the user create standalone executables that don't
   depend on dynamically linked libraries.  See README for more
   details.

 * Bugfix (commit 3843ea7): Rewrite pole mass tachyon check to fix a
   confusion between goldstone and Higgs bosons in the CP-violating
   MSSM.

 * Bugfix (commit e2009f7): Adding missing declaration of input
   parameters in the generated DependenceNum functions.  This fixes a
   compilation error in the NE6SSM or the UMSSM if ThetaWp is set to
   an expression that involves the charges.

 * Bugfix (commits d80c30f, e6c8dda): Correcting input scale of
   tan(beta) in the lowNMSSM according to SLHA-2 convention.  The
   model file lowNMSSMTanBetaAtMZ has been added, where tan(beta) is
   input at MZ.

FlexibleSUSY-1.1.1 [June, 08 2015]

 * Bugfix (commit e1ea433): Catch NaNs from Slavich's NMSSM 2-loop
   self-energies.

FlexibleSUSY-1.1.0 [May, 31 2015]

 * Feature: Calculation of DR-bar weak mixing angle from Fermi
   constant and Z pole mass.  The implementation is based on
   expressions from SoftSUSY and works for the SM, MSSM, NMSSM and
   their variants.  The method for the calculation of the weak mixing
   angle can be selected via the FSWeakMixingAngleInput variable in
   the FlexibleSUSY model file.
   Example:
   FSWeakMixingAngleInput = FSFermiConstant; (* or FSMassW *)
   Note: To achieve the maximum accuracy available, set the threshold
   corrections loop order to 2 (FlexibleSUSY block entry 7)

 * Feature: Support for non-SUSY models, renormalized in the MS-bar
   scheme.

 * Feature: 2-loop QCD corrections can be added when calculating the
   top pole mass from the top DR-bar mass.  These 2-loop contributions
   can be enabled/disabled using entries 13 or 4 of the FlexibleSUSY
   block in the SLHA input file.

 * Feature: In the shipped FlexibleSUSY model files, the corresponding
   default SARAH model file is specified.  This allows a user to
   create a new model with the simplified command:
   ./createmodel --name=CMSSM
   The default SARAH model file to be used with a given FlexibleSUSY
   model file can be set via FSDefaultSARAHModel = <model>;

 * Feature: Complex model parameters are now supported.

 * Feature: The CKM and PMNS matrix can now be used as low-energy
   inputs.  They are read from the VCKMIN and UPMNSIN input blocks,
   respectively.  Linked to this, the new model file CMSSMCKM was
   added to demonstrate the input of the CKM matrix at low energies.

 * Feature: Mark parameter points as invalid, for which the
   calculation of one of the pole masses failed due to
   non-convergence.

 * Feature: New (non-templated) intermediate model class
   <model>_mass_eigenstates, which is able to calculate the pole and
   running mass spectrum.  <model>_mass_eigenstates is derived from
   <model>_soft_parameters.  The templated model class
   <model><Two_scale> is now derived from <model>_mass_eigenstates .

 * Bugfix (commit 6da2cbd, 8113e32a): ensure that the MSSM-like CP-odd
   Higgs mass is used in the two-loop Higgs self-energies and
   tadpoles.  Before, there were cases where a Goldstone boson mass or
   a singlet-like pseudoscalar mass was used.

 * Bugfix (commit 29a0833): incorporate tadpole contributions in pole
   masses of singlets

 * Bugfix (commit c64a333): Softsusy's B1 function is now thread-save.
   Before commit c64a333, the tau pole mass was varying due to a race
   condition, if multi-threading is enabled and neither fflite nor
   looptoos is used.

 * Bugfix (commit d035544): Ignore trivial EWSB eqs.  Makes the MRSSM
   work in FlexibleSUSY with SARAH 4.5.x.

 * Bugfix (commit d8a1521): The SM() preprocessor macro has been
   renamed to LowEnergyConstant() in order to avoid collisions with
   the copy constructor of the SM model class.

 * Bugfix (commit 0c7a7ac): chop beta-function values smaller than the
   zero-threshold to avoid failures of the RK integrator.  The
   zero-threshold is 1e-11 by default and can be changed via
   Beta_function::set_zero_threshold() or entry 14 in the SLHA input
   file.

 * Bugfix (commit 29a1578): Ignore goldstone boson "pole mass"
   tachyons.

FlexibleSUSY-1.0.4 [January, 15 2015]

 * Add new user example program run_cmd_line_<model>.x to run a
   parameter point using command line parameters instead of an SLHA
   input file.

 * Allow input parameters in first guesses of scale definitions, for
   example
   SUSYScaleFirstGuess = Sqrt[Sqrt[LHInput[mq2[3,3]] * LHInput[mu2[3,3]]]]

 * Adding support for FlexibleSUSY addons.  They are placed inside the
   addons/ directory and can be configued and compiled via
   ./configure --with-addons=<addon> && make

 * Adding EWSB solvers using a fixed-point iteration (FPIRelative,
   FPIAbsolute, FPITadpole).  FPIRelative is now the first default
   solver used.  Thanks to Dylan Harries.

 * Adding new NMSSM model file `NUTNMSSM' with non-universal soft
   Higgs masses (EWSB output) and non-universal trilinear couplings
   A_lambda and A_kappa at MX.

 * Read user input W boson pole mass form SMINPUTS block entry 9.

 * Read user input Z boson pole mass from SMINPUTS block entry 4.

 * Automatic check for non-perturbative dimensionless model parameters
   at the high-scale.  The check can be disabled by stetting
   FSCheckPerturbativityOfDimensionlessParameters = False;
   in the model file.  The threshold can be set via the
   FSPerturbativityThreshold variable.  The default threshold is
   N[Sqrt[4 Pi]] = 3.54491.

 * Check for tree-level tachyons at each scale (MZ and M_SUSY)

 * Allow to force SLHA output for unphysical points (for example where
   tachyons exist) in FlexibleSUSY block, entry 12.

 * Bugfix (commit 6f7d3de): allow plain model parameters for scale
   definition, for example in the form SUSYScale = vu .

 * Bugfix (commit 44baa73): allow model parameters in first guesses of
   scale definitions, for example
   SUSYScaleFirstGuess = Sqrt[mq2[3,3] * mu2[3,3]]

 * Bugfix (commit 77dce8b): correct momentum guess for the calculation
   of the self-energies with LowPrecision.

 * Bugfix (commit fb0b906): Fix compilation with g++ 4.5.3.
