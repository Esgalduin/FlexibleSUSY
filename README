How to compile
==============

1. Make sure that you have the boost libraries version >= 1.36
   installed.  If not, you can download them from http://www.boost.org

2. Create the makefile using `./configure'.  Run `./configure --help'
   to see all options.

   If you want to use the boost libraries and headers from specific
   directories $BOOST_LIB, $BOOST_INC, you can run configure via

      $ ./configure --boost-lib-dir=$BOOST_LIB --boost-inc-dir=$BOOST_INC

3. To compile run `make'.  (Parallel make is supported via the -jN
   option, where N is the number of cores to use.)
