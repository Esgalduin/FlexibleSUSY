How to compile
==============

1. Make sure that you have the boost libraries version >= 1.36
   installed.  If not, you can download them from http://www.boost.org

2. To compile run `make'.  If you want to use the boost libraries from
   a specific directory, you can overwrite the `BOOSTLIBDIR',
   `BOOSTLIBS' (set to -lboost_unit_test_framework by default) and
   `BOOSTINC' variables.  For example

      $ make BOOSTINC=-I/usr/include BOOSTLIBDIR=/usr/lib
