FLEXIBLE FUTURE
===============

List of planned or possible future extensions, fixes, collaborations
and applications.


Planned major extensions
========================

 * FlexibleDecay - calcuating higgs and sparticle decays

 * Lattice method - new method for solving boundary value problem.

 * Leading two loop mh calculator.    			 

 * MicrOMEGAS interface

 * S, T, U variables as optional output

 * FlexibleTower, multiple boundary conditions


Fixes / minor extensions
========================

* create modified two scale algorithm where variables fixed at the low scale 
  have vlaues saved at the SUSY scale on the run up, to improve stability.

* a modification to two scale algorithm where negative scalar squared
  masses that can appear at an intermediate stage are used untouched
  in self-energies/tadpoles.  For this, one may use complex-valued
  loop functions from fflite that accept negative squared masses.

* E6SSM model issues in Hp coupling discussed with Florian Staub, 
  may need fix from FlexibleSUSY

* Provide abstract interface class with getters and setters for spectrum?
  There is a prototype of this being created for gambit 

* Provide methods which pass the spectum as a model object and/or slhaea object?
  ~Prototype GetSpec class can be found in:
  https://github.com/pathron/higgs-decays-NE6SSM 
  (see NE6SSM-SpecGen/models/NE6SSM/GetScale.hpp)

* make getters and setters safer? (currently incorrect acces returns
                                  eigen error at run time)

* provide better scanning routines?


Planned Collaborations
======================

* 3-loop SQCD corrections to Mh in the MSSM (H3m)
  Collaboration: R. Harlander, J. Klappert, A. Voigt

* FlexibleSUSY with Flavorkit: http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1434 
  (A. Voigt and F. Staub?).

* FlexibleSUSY in GAMBIT (P.Athron + rest of GAMBIT)

* What about other codes, learning how to link to relic density calculators
  maybe?

* Link with Fittino.


Planned applications
====================

* Improved HSSUSY
  Collaboration: E. Bagnaschi, A. Voigt, G. Weiglein
